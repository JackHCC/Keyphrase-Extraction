Air Pollution Affects Troops in Iraq: As Deadly as Terrorists?
The air pollution in Iraq is nearly as deadly to troops as the enemy is or so a new study finds out. Researchers from the University of Alaska presented the surprising information to the American Chemical Society this week during a meeting held in Anaheim, CA. There never seems to be good news of any kind associated with what seems like an endless war. Air pollution is just the latest negative thing to come to light. Apparently, the air pollution in Iraq is comprised of particulate matter a.k.a. fine particles which are being breathed in by U.S. troops. The particulate matter then lodges ""deep inside people's lungs"" which could even cause death to some. Researchers state that troops are breathing in air pollution that is ""10 times higher that the desirable levels in the U.S. National Ambient Air Quality Standards."" Sadly, it seems this is just another thing for our men and women in uniform to have to worry about. One can try to dodge bullets and bombs but how does one escape from the very air they breathe?
