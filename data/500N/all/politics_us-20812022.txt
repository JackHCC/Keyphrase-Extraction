NH Senate approves town spending caps
New Hampshire's Senate has approved a bill that would allow cities and towns to adopt spending caps. Bill sponsor David Boutin, R-Hooksett, says the idea is all about giving local budget control to taxpayers. The communities of Franklin, Derry, Laconia, Nashua, Dover, Rochester and Manchester have approved spending caps. In November, the state Supreme Court overturned Manchester's spending cap, saying such a cap violates laws governing local budget-making authority. Boutin said his bill would resolve that conflict and protect existing caps from legal challenges. The Senate passed the bill 19-5. The House has passed a similar bill. Advertisement
