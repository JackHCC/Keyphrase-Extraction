eBay releases iPad 2 sales
Apple has yet to reveal its official sales numbers for the iPad 2. But Friday we got a glimpse of how the tablet is selling, as eBay released its figures for the first two weeks of sales. About 12,000 iPad 2 tablets were sold in the period between the iPad 2’s U.S. and international launches. As CNET noted, the surprise number here is that the iPad 2 is being resold in the United States at a much higher rate than was the first iPad. According to eBay’s figures, 64 percent of its iPad 2 sales are in the United States, compared with just 35 percent with the original iPad. When it comes to resales overseas, Russia snapped up the most devices — 500 — in the tablet’s first two weeks on the market, followed by Canada, Hong Kong, Japan and the United Kingdom.
