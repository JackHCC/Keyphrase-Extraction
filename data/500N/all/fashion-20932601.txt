Fall 2011 fashion week goes Native American
Native American motifs appeared on the Fall 2011 runway. While always an essential part of street style, Native American motifs have filtered up to the runway. Before even Corinne Day's photograph of Kate Moss donning an Indian Headdress on the 1990 cover of ""The Face,"" feathers and fringe were always key elements of rock & roll and bohemian style. A recent ""New York"" magazine article cited one European magazine as reporting that ""in the ""US hipster scene"" it's cool to dress like Indians."" Proenza Schouler credits a road trip to Santa Fe as their inspiration for their fall 2011 show. Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez created their own exploded, pixelated version of Navajo blanket pattern. Isabel Marant showed lust-worthy jeans beaded with Native American motifs paired with thigh-high fringed boots. Fringe also adorned her dresses and tops. Rag & Bone's fall show was summarized as ""Inuit-Meets-Alpine-Skier."" They even emulated the ""weathered Eskimo"" look in their make-up - trying to recreate sunburnt skin, natural-looking make-up and loose, tousled braids.

For many seasons, Pendleton has colloborated with Opening Ceremony in a capsule called ""Pendleton Meets Opening Ceremony"" to create fashion-forward styles in their traditional prints that are sold at their stores, Barney's and even the Paris-based Colette. For the budget-conscious, Urban Outfitters also carries Pendleton t-shirts, towels and messenger bags. On the cover of Nylon, Kate Bosworth wears a pair of beaded Native American-inspired earrings from her Jewelmint line with stylist Cher Coulter. There is also the classic Minnetonka moccasin or fringe boot that is the go-to shoe for many girls. No matter what the option, these Native American-inspired pieces instantly add a rock & roll, laidback cool to any outfit, which is always perfect for summer.
