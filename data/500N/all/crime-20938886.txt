Brain swelling tied to bear death BERLIN - The Berlin zoo's celebrity polar bear, Knut, drowned after swelling of his brain caused him to collapse and fall into his enclosure's pool, experts said Friday. A necropsy of the four-year-old bear who died suddenly two weeks ago showed he was suffering from encephalitis, an irritation and swelling of the brain that was likely brought on by an infection, pathologist Claudia Szentiks said. It remains unclear what that infection was, but Achim Gruber, a professor of veterinary medicine at Berlin's Free University, said it likely was a virus. Knut, who was born at the zoo, quickly rose to celebrity status as an irresistibly cute cub who had been rejected by his mother. Knut died March 19 in front of hundreds of visitors, turning around several times and then falling into the water in his enclosure. Experts who examined Knut found large quantities of fluid in his lungs, supporting the conclusion that the immediate cause of death was drowning. But they said that even if he hadn't fallen into the water he likely wouldn't have survived. - AP Suicide bomber kills 3 in Fallujah BAGHDAD - A suicide bomber disguised as a street cleaner walked up to soldiers outside a mosque and blew himself up Friday, killing two of the troops and a worshiper in a western Iraqi city that was once an al-Qaeda in Iraq hotbed.
