""Glee"" star Matthew Morrison announces summer tour
This time, Sue Sylvester couldn't stop the music. Matthew Morrison, who plays the glee club teacher Mr. Schuester on Fox network's ""Glee,"" announced a nationwide summer concert tour Friday. He'll perform songs from his upcoming solo album, including the recently debuted single ""Summer Rain,"" as well as favorites from the show. Or maybe the five-week, 22-city tour is just an elaborate cover-up to find a replacement for his New Directions singers. Regional glee clubs can compete to open for Morrison when he comes to their town, an opportunity co-sponsored by the VH1 Save the Music Foundation. Clubs can submit their entries here. Then again, this could be a chance for Morrison to expand his career options yet again. He teamed with the comedy website Funny or Die to create a series of original videos; some will premiere on the site, and some will be worked into his concerts. Morrison will hit the Beacon Theater in New York on July 1 and wrap the tour at Nokia Theater in Los Angeles on July 23.
