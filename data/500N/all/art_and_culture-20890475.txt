Depp could be back for more Pirates
Johnny Depp will be asked to make a fifth Pirates Of The Caribbean film if the fourth instalment is a success. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer said he already has a screenplay in the works for a fifth Pirates tale, which would follow the forthcoming Pirates Of The Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. ""As long as the audience embraces this one, we'll certainly try to make another one. It's really up to Johnny. He loves the character,"" he said. The original three Pirates blockbusters ended up as a trilogy continuing the same key characters and story line. But Jerry said On Stranger Tides - the first Pirates flick shot with digital 3D cameras - and future Pirates films will be stand-alone stories continuing the adventures of Johnny's woozy buccaneer Captain Jack Sparrow. ""The audience told us (at test screenings of On Stranger Tides) what they loved about it is that it was fresh, it was new, it was a whole new story,"" Jerry said. ""So that will carry over into the next one, too, to give it something fresh and different.""
