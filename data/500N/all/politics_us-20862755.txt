State Rep. Knollenberg challenges US Rep. Peters
Republican state Rep. Marty Knollenberg says he's running for Congress in a district now held by Gary Peters, who unseated Knollenberg's father. The younger Knollenberg said Thursday that his staff is filing candidacy papers with the Federal Election Commission. The Troy legislator says he's entering the race now so as not to fall behind the Bloomfield Township Democrat in fundraising. Knollenberg says creating jobs and controlling federal spending top his agenda. Peters beat then-U.S. Rep. Joe Knollenberg in the November 2010 election for Michigan's Ninth U.S. House district. Michigan is losing one congressional seat based on the 2010 Census, and redistricting will reshape district boundaries. Peters' staff declined immediate comment on Knollenberg's announcement.
