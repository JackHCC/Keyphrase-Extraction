Twitter Ditches QuickBar A.K.A. ""DickBar""
Twitter has decided to ditch the ""DickBar."" The application for the iPhone and iPad is officially known as the QuickBar. It is a feature that helped users keep track of trending tweets. However, it got the ""DickBar"" label after users complained that the app obscured other tweets and was just a ploy by CEO Dick Costolo to push Promoted Tweets. It comes as no surprise that Twitter users would be upset if they feel Promoted Tweets is in fact promoted a bit too much. It's in Costolo and co-founder and head of product development Jack Dorsey's interest to support their advertising partners. If tweets are highlighted, that helps. Except nobody in a democracy goes for propaganda much. American users don't like a social networking company deciding what gets featured and what doesn't. Let the users make that decision by their own activity. Twitter has removed the feature from the App Store. So, are they done with the ""DickBar""? Not quite. The social networking company may bring the feature back - new and improved. What exactly is new and improved remains to be seen.
