Skewed priorities
Re ""Activists in GOP work for repeal of guest-worker law"" (Tribune, March 26): One need look no further than the tea party and the current outrage of Salt Lake County Republicans to truly gauge their skewed and perverted priorities. Are they putting forth their effort and financial resources to unseat those in the Legislature who passed one of the most inflammatory laws, House Bill 477, or to repeal it? Of course not! They'd rather focus on unseating Gov. Gary Herbert, Sen. Curt Bramble, R-Provo, and Rep. Holly Richardson, R-Cedar Hills, for supporting an immigration bill that isn't prejudiced against minorities, even after it got a stamp of approval from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the faith of a large percentage of legislators.
