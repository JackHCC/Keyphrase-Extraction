England rugby star Ben Foden cautioned for criminal damage
England rugby player Ben Foden has been cautioned for causing criminal damage. The Northampton full-back was celebrating his club's league win over Wasps in central London in the early hours of Monday when trouble flared. Officers were called after reports of an altercation in Old Park Lane, central London, at 0330 BST. Foden, 25, was arrested then bailed but later accepted the police caution. A 23-year-old received a caution for theft from a vehicle. A Rugby Football Union spokesman said it would wait to see if Northampton would take any action against Foden before deciding its response. The club was unavailable for comment. The former Sale Sharks player scored the only try in England's 17-9 victory over France at Twickenham in March and has 15 caps to his name.
