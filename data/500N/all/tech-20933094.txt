Potential benefits include reducing the deficit, fostering the next generation of wireless technologies and expanding wireless coverage, according to a White House news release Friday. The administration wants to devote more spectrum to wireless high-speed Internet service, or broadband, and proposes paying television-station owners who voluntarily surrender excess airwaves. The proposal needs congressional approval. Broadcasters say they want the U.S. to examine how spectrum is used before beginning any auctions. - Bloomberg News
