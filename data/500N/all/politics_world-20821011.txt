Robert Marshall-Andrews and his daughter Laura
A report with the heading Former Labour MP’s daughter held by Italian police for being drunk told officers ""she was the daughter of Cabinet minister’ incorrectly identified Kathryn Emily Andrews as the daughter of former Labour MP Robert Marshall-Andrews. In fact, neither Mr Marshall-Andrews nor his daughter Laura were in any way connected to the incident. We apologise to them for the misunderstanding and any embarrassment caused.
