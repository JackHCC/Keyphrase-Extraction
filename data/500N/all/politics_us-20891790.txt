Mayor Bloomberg&#39;s approval ratings are falling fast, Marist College poll finds
Mayor Bloomberg's approval ratings are falling faster than the snow in December's blizzard. Hizzoner's approval rating tanked since last month, dropping from 44% in February to 40% this week, according to a new poll from the Marist College polling institute - and it hasn't even snowed since then. The poll comes as Bloomberg prepares to lay off more than 4,600 teachers and close 20 fire companies to balance the budget. ""The mayor continues to make tough choices in a difficult time, which is what he was elected to do,"" said Bloomberg spokesman Stu Loeser.
