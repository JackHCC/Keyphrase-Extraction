Craig ""will do Larsson justice""
Daniel Craig will do Stieg Larsson justice, film producer Soren Staermose has said. The 007 star has been filming his role as investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist in David Fincher's Hollywood remake of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, and Soren - who produced both adaptations - reckons he is the right man for the role. ""There's no doubt about that - Daniel is a great actor and very likeable, so we are super-confident,"" he said. The Swedish film producer also heaped praise on Rooney Mara, who portrays troubled computer hacker Lisbeth Salander, originally played by Noomi Rapace. ""It is a big role, but she's a very good actress and she goes all the way,"" Soren continued. ""I saw her in The Social Network and thought she was incredible. She is much younger, and is going to do a faithful adaptation. She is extraordinary."" While the Swedish big-screen adaptations of Stieg Larsson's best-selling novel trilogy have been a hit, Soren hopes David's remake will bring a new audience. ""We are so proud to get David Fincher on board. The Stieg Larsson family is very proud too, because a big director like him and the way he can adapt such a big, huge book,"" he said. ""With an American movie, when they cross borders, they can reach corners of the world that we don't hit with our Swedish version. A big US version is very important for the Stieg Larsson estate too. We are very happy."" :: The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest is available on DVD on April 11.
