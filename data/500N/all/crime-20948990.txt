NJ man charged in child sex case gets probation after pleading guilty to lesser offense
TRENTON, N.J. - A New Jersey man initially accused of participating in the alleged gang-rape of a 7-year-old girl after her 15-year-old stepsister sold her for sex has been sentenced to probation. Twenty-year-old Timear Lewis of Trenton was among six people charged in the case after the younger girl was allegedly assaulted at a party in a Trenton apartment building in March 2010. But nearly all were eventually offered pleas bargains to lesser charges after the case began to unravel. Authorities lacked DNA evidence to prosecute, and the older girl gave varying accounts of what supposedly happened. Lewis, who was 19 at the time, pleaded guilty to a trespassing charge for being in a vacant apartment without the owner's permission. He was ordered Friday to serve three years' probation.
