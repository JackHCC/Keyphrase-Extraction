A changed life
THREE-MINUTE AWAKENING: The day after I had the operation, a wonderful young woman came in and dragged me to rehab. I told her how much I hated her, and she put me on the treadmill for about 3 minutes. After that, I just kept exercising. Life is good and I want to enjoy it as long as I can. We built a new home in 2000 and put in a big-screen TV, and now we have three machines facing it: a bike, a combination treadmill/stepper and a stretching machine. So it's not boring like it would be otherwise. I do that at least a half-hour a day, and three days a week I go to Over Fifty and Fit at Minnetonka Community Education. SCALING DOWN: I spent my life in food distribution. When I was around it, I didn't pay any attention to my weight. Today when I bend over, my stomach isn't in the way. I have an old doctor's scale that I got in 1967, and that's what I stand on every morning. When I started I had to put it on the 250 and add 30 pounds. Then I moved it to 200, and now 150. I got to my goal weight - under 190 - about 90 days ago. FOR THE DOGS: I loved food so much, and I always ate everything that was served to me, never leaving anything on the plate that was placed in front of me. When I decided to lose weight, I went to a class where the leader stated that it wasn't the last taste on the plate that was best, but that it was the first taste. That hit me like a brick. Since that time, I never clean up my plate, whether I am home or in a restaurant. When I go to a restaurant I cut it in half and bring the rest home to my dogs. DRAWING INSPIRATION: After I was diagnosed [with diabetes], it was on track to getting worse: I would wake up in the middle of the night sweating, having to get sugar into my blood, etc. That does not happen to me now. When I was at the VA in January, the nurse said I should teach a class on how to leave Type 2 diabetes behind because of my numbers from the blood draw. I don't stick myself anymore.
