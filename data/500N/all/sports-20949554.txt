Chelsea possess best attack of Premier League: Carlo Ancelotti
Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti has said that his Manchester United counterpart Sir Alex Ferguson can keep Wayne Rooney, as his team has the best attack in the Premier League. ""Rooney is a fantastic player. I like him. He's a fantastic striker, but I do not want to change. And I am sure Sir Alex does not want any changes either. We have the best group of forwards in the Premier League. I am happy with these strikers, and I do not want to swap them with anybody,"" the Daily Express quoted Ancelotti as saying. Ancelotti has a strong strike-force in Didier Drogba, Nicolas Anelka, Salomon Kalou and Fernando Torres. Despite this, as Chelsea head to Stoke today, needing to win all their nine league games in order to retain their League title, none of the four strikers have scored in the last two months, since Torres joined the team from Liverpool. However, Chelsea has managed to get by, having lost only once in their past eight games in the league, thanks to goals from their midfield, Frank Lampard. Chelsea takes on United next week in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final, with Ancelotti demanding a better performance from his strikers. ""You don't lose that ability to score. If you are a top scorer, you'll stay like that until the end of your career. It comes back,"" he said. Ancelotti has long maintained that the nine point gap between his team and Ferguson's United is too great to contemplate overtaking and winning a second straight title. However, Chelsea players claim that a title charge is back on now after their recent revival.
