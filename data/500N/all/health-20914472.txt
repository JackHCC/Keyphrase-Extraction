Sweet! Candy eaters surprisingly slimmer
It's junk food, not chocolate that contributes to obesity, study suggests Those with a sweet tooth might not need to feel so guilty about admitting it. People who eat candy and chocolate tend to have smaller waists, weigh less and have a lower body mass index (BMI) than those who don't indulge in these treats, a new study says. In addition, candy and chocolate consumers had a 14 percent lower risk of elevated blood pressure and a 15 percent decreased risk of having metabolic syndrome - a collection of symptoms that put people at risk for heart disease and stroke. However, the results do not suggest that eating candy helps you lose pounds, the researchers say. Rather, it may be that candy consumers exercise more to make up for the additional calories they're taking in.
