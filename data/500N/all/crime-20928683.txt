Deputy DA in Vegas who handled Paris Hilton, Bruno Mars cases quits after crack cocaine arrest
LAS VEGAS - A Las Vegas prosecutor who handled recent drug cases involving Paris Hilton and pop singer Bruno Mars has resigned following his arrest in a crack cocaine case. Clark County District Attorney David Roger tells The Associated Press he accepted David Schubert's resignation Friday. A telephone call to Schubert went unanswered. His lawyer, William Terry, didn't immediately respond to a message. The 47-year-old Schubert was arrested March 19 after Las Vegas police reported watching him in a white BMW sedan buy $40 worth of rock cocaine in a neighborhood east of the Las Vegas Strip. Schubert was a 10-year veteran prosecutor and liaison for the last two years to a federal drug task force. He's free pending a May 19 court date on felony conspiracy and cocaine possession charges.
