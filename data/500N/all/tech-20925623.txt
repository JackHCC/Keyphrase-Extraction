UberSocial fixes privacy bug
The Twitter app UberSocial reported Thursday that is has fixed a bug that compromised the privacy of some direct messages on Twitter. Steve Chadima, chief marketing officer with UberMedia, told NetworkWorld that the bug was fixed on the company’s servers late Thursday. The bug only affected users who sent messagers over 140 characters using the “d username” command. Twitter’s @safety account alerted users to the bug Thursday night. UberSocial, formerly known as UberTwitter, told users that it had fixed the bug in a Thursday night blog post and on its Twitter feed today. Thx again to @_tmi and @twitlonger, the DM privacy issue is fixed on all apps using these services.
