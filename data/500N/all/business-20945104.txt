Retail banks in Britain stung in report
LONDON, April 2 (UPI) - A parliamentary committee said banking executives in Britain had a myopic view of retail banking. ""The chief executive officers of the large incumbents told the committee UK retail banking was enormously competitive, but a far larger range of witnesses described the industry as close to an oligopoly,"" said MP Andrew Tyrie, who chairs the Treasury committee for the House of Commons. Tyrie was responding to a recent committee report that said retail banking in Britain was not competitive enough, the British Broadcasting Corp. reported Saturday. The British Bankers' Association said it was ""working closely with the Office of Fair Trading"" to address concerns such as increasing clarity in pricing practices for bank services and making it easier for customers to transfer funds to new accounts. ""Straightforward account switching and transparent fees and charges are important for competition and for customers, so they know where they stand and are able to choose,"" the BBA said.
