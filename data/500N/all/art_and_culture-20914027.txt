Girlfriend helps Wood clean up act
Ronnie Wood's new model girlfriend claims she is helping him to clean up his act - but revealed she had no idea who he was when they met. Brazilian model Ana Araujo, 30, said she is now encouraging the boozy Rolling Stones star to lead a healthier lifestyle. The model and children's charity campaigner said: ""I am trying to encourage him. When you love someone of course you want to support and help them."" Ronnie, 63, has had a lengthy battle with drink problems. And after leaving his now ex-wife Jo, he enjoyed numerous booze-fuelled nights with former girlfriend Ekaterina Ivanova. Ana, a guest at the launch of Wrigley's Extra Ice chewing gum, said she did not know the guitarist when they met at London's 100 Club. Speaking at the dinner at John Torode's London restaurant, Smith's of Smithfield, she said she did not recognise him because she had spent so much time ""away from things, meditating and doing yoga"".
