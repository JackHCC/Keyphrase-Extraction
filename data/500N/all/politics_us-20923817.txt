Tea Party Express Opens 2012 Campaign Against Obama
The Tea Party Express became the first organization to buy national advertising to oppose the re-election of President Obama, filing a report on Friday with the Federal Election Commission disclosing more than $40,000 in ad buys on Fox News Channel and Fox Business Network. The group, which became the largest independent backer of Tea Party candidates during last year's election, also aired an ad opposing Obama in March on local television in Madison, Wis.
