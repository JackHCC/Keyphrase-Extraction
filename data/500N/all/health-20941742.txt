Hands-free faucet not so clean
Hands-free electronic faucets have widely been assumed to help fight the spread of germs. But a team at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore has discovered that at their facility, electronic faucets were more likely to be contaminated with Legionella bacteria than the manual type, possibly because the electronic faucets have a complicated system of valves that is difficult to clean. The study will be presented at the annual meeting of the Society for Health Care Epidemiology.
