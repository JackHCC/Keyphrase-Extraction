This spring, our Breton stripe T-shirts are ""resting"" Suck It And See New Monkeys album is poppier than Humbug. Alex's hair's looking partics good, too Zara's narrow-leg Studio trousers In kir royale pink. The most fun you can have in a pair of trousers. A touch of the Isabel Marant red leathers, but so much easier to wear New Nike for Liberty high-tops Mint green florals with a white swoosh. Spring-like and practical with it Going down Too-long trouser hems As in trying to make that Céline skateboard ad work in the real world. Face it: you'll trip and ruin your trousers Self-harm by social media The people you follow on Twitter/befriend on Facebook purely to torture yourself with how fabulous they are. Yes, you do. Stop it Skulls On clothes. Total. Cliché. And it's not Halloween for six months Smug marathoners The new smug marrieds.
