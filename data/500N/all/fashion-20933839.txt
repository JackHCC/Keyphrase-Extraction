Joran van der Sloot living like king in prison, says slain woman's dad Lima, Peru - Accused murderer, Joran van der Sloot is living a life of luxury behind bars, says the father of Stefany Flores, the Peruvian woman he's accused of killing last Spring. Ricardo Flores said van der Sloot is ""living like a king"" as he awaits trial for Stephany's murder in Peru's Miguel Castro Castro Prison. Stefany, 21, was found dead in the Dutchman's Lima, Peru hotel room on May 30, 2010. Peruvian police say he confessed to killing the woman in a fit of rage, however, van der Sloot now argues he was coerced into a confession. Recently his lawyer announced he will admit culpability for the crime, but use an insanity defense. Flores was interviewed on Peru TV and said that although the famous Lima prison is known for being rough, crowded and dangerous, van der Sloot has been given a private cell. He also claims that van der Sloot is allowed to smoke marijuana and has more exercise privileges than the other inmates.
