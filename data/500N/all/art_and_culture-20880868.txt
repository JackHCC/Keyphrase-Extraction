Phish Phavors New York With 3-Day Phestival In Phinger Lakes
Big announcement today from Phish HQ: the quartet will be playing a three day festival in New York in July. Super Ball IX will be held at Watkins Glen International (about a five hours drive from the city) from July 1st to the 3rd, and as our resident hippie here at Gothamist HQ points out, ""I don't think there's been a concert there of this magnitude since Summer Jam, perhaps because that one was a traffic nightmare."" Perfect, because nothing says Independence Day like burning some phossil phuel with your phellow Americans. In their announcement today the band does point out that, yes, this is ""the first major music festival held at Watkins Glen since 1973""s legendary Summer Jam."" They also note it will be their ""biggest ball ever"" (of their nine, and counting), so be prepared: (Summer Jam got into Guiness for the ""Largest audience at a pop festival,"" with 600,000 in attendance). Not scared of a little traffic? Tickets go on sale this coming Monday, April 4th, right here - and more information can be found in their enjoyable little video below. Phish notes that Super Ball IX continues a tradition that began with The Clifford Ball in August of 1996 - which was awesome, and we may or may not be in this video taken there.
