Pinch-hitter David Murphy delivered a tiebreaking, two-run double in the eighth inning and the Texas Rangers rallied for a 9-5 victory over the Boston Red Sox on Friday after raising their American League championship flag. Murphy's slicing liner off Daniel Bard (0-1) kicked up chalk when it landed on the left-field line. That sent Rangers newcomers Mike Napoli and Yorvit Torrealba home to break a 5-all tie. Murphy scored on a double by Elvis Andrus before another double by AL MVP Josh Hamilton. Napoli, Ian Kinsler and Nelson Cruz all homered off Jon Lester for Texas, which played its season opener exactly five months after a Game 5 loss to San Francisco at home ended its first World Series. Darren Oliver (1-0) got the victory after allowing a tying homer to David Ortiz in the eighth. Adrian Gonzalez had two hits and drove in three runs in his Boston debut. Carl Crawford went 0 for 4 with three strikeouts while leaving a runner in scoring position each at-bat. White Sox 15, Indians 10 CLEVELAND
