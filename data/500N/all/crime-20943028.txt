Dozens Injured in 50-Car Crash in Abu Dhabi
ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates - Police say at least 50 vehicles were involved in a chain-reaction crash in dense fog on the main highway between Dubai and Abu Dhabi, leaving dozens of people injured. The pileup Saturday extended for more than 500 yards (meters) and included cars, buses and vans. Some local media reports say two people were killed, but police reports did not immediately mention fatalities. The busy highway between the United Arab Emirates' two main cities was closed for hours. In March 2008, three people were killed and 300 injured in a similar fog-shrouded pileup on the same stretch of highway.
