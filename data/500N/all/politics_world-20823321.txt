Air raid on Tripoli, explosions in southeast suburb: witness
Tripoli (ANTARA News/AFP) - Explosions shook an eastern suburb of Tripoli late Wednesday as warplanes staged a raid on the Libyan capital, a witness told AFP by telephone, and Libya`s news agency reported. Shortly after the aircraft flew over the east and southeast suburbs of the city, explosions could be heard in the southeast Salaheddine district, said the witness, speaking on condition of anonymity. The raids had targetted a military site in the area, the witness added. But Jana, the official Libyan news agency, said ""a civilian site in Tripoli has been the target tonight of bombing from the colonialist crusader aggressor,"" their term for the coalition forces. ""The price of any bomb or missile launched by the crusaders on the Libyans is paid for by the Qatari and Emirati governments,"" the agency added, referring to the two Arab nations that have joined the coalition`s military campaign.
