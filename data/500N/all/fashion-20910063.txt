Dior Will Replace Galliano Whenever They Darn Well Please, All Right?
Comment It's Riccardo Tisci! Wait, it's Jean Paul Gaultier? Or Olivier Theyskens? Oh my God, when will they announce the replacement so we can rest easy that Dior will still be carried in stores and photographed in magazines?! Of course, the label is doing just fine. At a shareholders' meeting for Dior yesterday, LVMH chief Bernard Arnault announced that Dior's large design team is functioning smoothly without a creative leader for now, and that they'll name Galliano's successor when they feel like it. As evidenced by the label's fall collection, which walked at its scheduled time without a hitch and received perfectly decent reviews, there's a large and capable group of people behind the Dior label who can steer the ship. Also, Dior's revenues were up a solid 15 percent in the year 2010, so people are obviously still buying the label. Reports Women's Wear Daily : “Nothing has been decided,” said Arnault, explaining that Dior would see a number of candidates and then reflect on its options — with no specific deadline in mind, and only taking a decision when “conviction” arrives. In the interim, Dior’s design studios would soldier on making collections. “They are effective, creative and accustomed to doing so,” he assured. “The calendar will be respected,” added Dior chief executive Sidney Toledano, suggesting Dior will not shun the Paris runways, even absent a creative leader. In the meantime, Arnault seems even gleeful about the guessing game that even his own shareholders are playing: Told by one shareholder Dior might consider French couturier Jean Paul Gaultier, who recently wrapped up a seven-year stint as the women’s ready-to-wear designer at HermÃ¨s, Arnault replied merrily: “I’ll note your suggestion.” Let's not forget, this is the guy who kept his Hermजs purchases hidden from the company itself, so it's safe to say he can play his cards close to his chest. When they feel like telling us, we'll know. Record Sales, Earnings at LVMH [WWD]
