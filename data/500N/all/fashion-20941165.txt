Evelyne Politanoff: Balenciaga And Spain, The Art Of Cristobal Balenciaga At de Young Museum
Cristobal Balenciaga: "" His name became synonymous with perfection and elegance."" ~ Baroness Pauline de Rothschild, 1973 On March 26, 2011, the Balenciaga and Spain will open at the de Young Museum in San Francisco. The exhibition - curated by Hamish Bowles, European editor at large of Vogue - features 120 haute couture garments, hats and headdresses designed by Cristobal Balenciaga (1895-1972). The collection illustrates Balenciaga's expansive creative vision, which incorporated references to Spanish art - with the iconic 1939 Infanta dress, a modernist interpretation of the dresses worn by the Infanta Margarita in Velazquez's celebrated portraits - bullfighting, dance, regional costume and the pageantry of the royal court and religious ceremonies. As legendary fashion editor Diana Vreeland described him, ""Balenciaga was the true son of a strong country filled with style, vibrant color and a fine history, ""who"" remained forever a Spaniard... You can feel the pulse of Spain beat in every garment in Balenciaga and Spain. A dress ruffle and polka-dot patterns inspired by the flamenco dancers; sumptuous embroidery and embellishments that glitters on a bolero jacket worn by a matador; clean and simple lines that extrapolate the minimalist rhythms and volumes of the vestments of Spanish nuns and priests; a velvet-trimmed evening gown aesthetically indebted to the farthingale robe of a Velazquez Infanta. Cecil Beaton hailed him as "" Fashion's Picasso"": ""In his work Balenciaga shows the refinement of France and the strengh of Spain. He uses fabric like a sculptor working in marble.""
