Police identify man killed in pursuit
Police have identified a man killed in a Zions Bank robbery Friday and have arrested a second man in the case. Steven Charles Leonard, 63, was shot by officers after he made clear actions toward them while running away in an apartment courtyard, according to a Salt Lake City Police news release. The man was taken to a hospital where he later died. Police also arrested Jason Gibson, 37, for suspicion of aggravated robbery and homicide and fleeing from police. The officer involved in the shooting has been placed on paid administrative leave, per department policy. The shooting occurred around 5:30 p.m. on Friday near 400 South and 1600 West, said police spokeswoman Lt. Melody Gray. Just after 5 p.m., officers responded to a report of an armed bank robbery at a Zions Bank at 400 South and 700 East, Gray said. A man entered the bank with a gun and demanded money. He fled in a black SUV driven by Gibson, police said. The SUV was spotted on 400 South near 800 West by an officer who attempted to stop it. A chase ensued, police said. Gibson later pulled over and surrendered to police, while Leonard got out of the SUV and allegedly fled on foot into an apartment complex courtyard where he was shot, Gray said. The shooting is under investigation by Salt Lake City Police Department homicide investigators and the Salt Lake County District Attorney's Office. Leonard does have a criminal history, involving shoplifting and drugs, but nothing within the past few years. Copyright 2011 The Salt Lake Tribune. All rights reserved.
