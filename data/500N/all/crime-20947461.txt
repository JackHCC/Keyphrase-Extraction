Man escapes prison TWICE after his wife sends faxes ordering his release
To break out of a modern prison is one thing, but to do it twice is quite something. That's exactly what 57-year-old Jose Carlos Serna did, and each time he escaped from custody by the same method. His wife sent a fax to court officials, ordering that they release him, and they did what she commanded each time. In December he was in a cell at Arganda del Rey courthouse awaiting trial when officers received a fax purportedly from a regional court. It was followed by a phone call from someone claiming to be a court official, corroborating the release order. Officers did try to verify the order, but their calls went unanswered. When they received a second call, confirming Serena's release, he was freed and put into a waiting taxi. Both of the calls were from his wife, Gema Maria Serna, who police tracked down to a house in the northern suburb of San Lorenzo del Escorial. Last time Serna used the trick on police he escaped from Valdermoro jail. He was in prison after he headed a gang that kidnapped a Spanish businessman in 2008, holding him captive in the Portuguese beach resort of the Algarve. Since his last escape Serna had rented several houses, including the heavy fortified suburban home where he was arrested. Police said he had equipped the house with reinforced window protection and a secret entrance that could not be easily detected or approached. He had also hired a number of men to drive him around while pretending to be an Italian university professor. Officers broke into the house through a skylight to find him after he hid in a hollowed out sofa. Top 10 prison breaks John Dillinger - Lima, Ohio He hot two guards using smuggled guards in 1933.
