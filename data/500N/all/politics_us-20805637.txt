Idol Meter looks at Season 10""s ""quirkier characters""
Ken Barnes takes a look at three of American Idol ""s ""quirkier characters"" in this week's Idol Meter post. Scotty McCreery: ""The inspired way he countrified Stevie Wonder last week breeds confidence he can easily do the same with Elton John tonight."" Naima Adedapo: ""[ Dancing in the Street ] may have put her on the right track, but she needs to pick the right track from the Elton John catalog - steering away, for instance, from the ballads."" Casey Abrams: ""To avoid the dreaded Siobhan Magnus Syndrome, he has to grab an instrument and show off those dazzling vocal chops.""
