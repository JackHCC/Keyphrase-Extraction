New daily paper for Zimbabwe
A new newspaper has made a surprise appearance on the streets of Zimbabwe's capital, Harare. Dummy copies of the paper, called The Mail, were handed out free yesterday ahead of its official launch next week. According to SW Radio Africa correspondent Simon Muchemwa, the paper appears to be apolitical, but there are rumours that it has been financed by a youth wing of ZANU-PF, the party headed by President Robert Mugabe. The Mail joins the Daily News, NewsDay, The Chronicle, and the state-friendly Herald to become Zimbabwe's fifth daily paper. Source: SWRadioAfrica
