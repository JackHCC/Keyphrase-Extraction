East Coast polish meets West Coast cool as two popular designers come to Washington this weekend.

A celeb favorite, the 24 year-old couturier and ready-to-wear designer is now selling pieces from his spring collection at Hysteria, appearing today and tomorrow. Both trunk shows are open to the public. Turk told Washington Post Express that her current collection was inspired by “Palm Springs prints” and “vintage clothing, as well as by artwork purchased from textile mills that closed.” Berardi looked eastward to the South of France for inspiration, basing his spring collection on Jean-Luc Godard’s 1960 film “Breathless.” Catch them both this weekend. Trina Turk Trunk Show Friday, April 1st, 12:00 p.m.- 6:00 p.m. Saturday, April 2nd, 10:00 a.m.- 6:00 p.m. Sunday, April 3rd, 9:00 a.m.- 2:00 p.m. Meet the designer Saturday from noon- 2:00 p.m. Donovan House
