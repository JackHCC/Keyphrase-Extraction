Undersea volcanoes don&#39;t just ooze, they also explode
And study that finds high levels of carbon dioxide confirms it, scientists say Deep-sea volcanoes can explode instead of just oozing, scientists now confirm. The new proof - higher-than-expected levels of carbon dioxide in the magma from a volcano off the coast of Oregon - suggests the volcanoes may play a greater role in global climate than thought. Of all the volcanic activity on Earth, 75 percent to 80 percent of it takes place at deep-sea ridges in the middle of the oceans. Most of these volcanoes apparently spew out huge volumes of lava instead of erupting explosively, as many volcanoes on land do. It is a high level of gas trapped in a volcano's magma that normally fuels explosive volcanic bursts. This level has long been thought to be low at mid-ocean ridges; moreover, potential undersea explosions would be suppressed by the crushing pressure from the surrounding water. However, based on volcanic ash found at certain sites, geologists have speculated over the last decade that explosive eruptions do take place in deep-sea volcanoes. Now researchers say they have proof.
