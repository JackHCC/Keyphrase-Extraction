U.S. calls on all parties in Cote d'Ivoire to exercise restraint
WASHINGTON, March 31 (Xinhua) - A U.S. senior diplomat on Thursday called on all parties in Cote d'Ivoire to ""exercise restraint"" and make the protection of civilians their ""highest priority."" ""The people of the Cote d'Ivoire have already paid a very high price for democracy. We call upon both sides to ensure that civilians do not pay an even higher price in the future,"" said Johnnie Carson, Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs. He warned that ""those who choose not to heed this call"" will be held accountable for the ""atrocities and the human rights violations"" that they commit. Carson urged Laurent Gbagbo, the incumbent leader of Cote d' Ivoire, to seize the opportunity to ""step aside peacefully"", and his supporters to ""lay down their arms and not to engage in urban conflict."" Forces backing Cote d'Ivoire's presidency claimant, Alassane Ouattara, on Thursday claimed to reach the gate of Abidjan after days of southward military advances. The United Nations troops in Cote d'Ivoire, who support the Ouattara camp, have taken control of Abidjan airport, media reports said on Thursday. Meanwhile, the Ouattara camp has given his presidential rival Gbagbo a 1900 GMT ultimatum to step down.
