Popping off on calories
WASHINGTON - Movie-going tubbies won't have to worry about their tubs of popcorn giving them a guilt trip. Even though the Food and Drug Administration is instituting new calorie-labeling requirements for food, movie theaters will be exempt. A tub of butter-laden popcorn can contain well above 1,000 calories. Along with movie emporiums, exemptions have been made for airplanes, bowling alleys and other businesses whose primary business is not to sell food , according to the FDA. Movie theaters pushed to be exempted after guidelines published last year included them. The FDA is imposing new requirements that will force chain restaurants with 20 or more locations, along with bakeries, grocery stores, convenience stores and coffee chains, to clearly post the number of calories in each food item. The rules will also apply to vending machines. The calorie counts will apply to an estimated 280,000 establishments.
