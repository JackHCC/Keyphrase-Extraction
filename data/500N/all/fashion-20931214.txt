Hand-dyed graphic garments colour debut of clothing line from Anu Raina
TORONTO - Textile designer and artist Anu Raina unveiled a debut clothing collection of graphic scarves and separates at Toronto's LG Fashion Week on Friday. The hand-dyed garments encompassed bolder blueish greens along with washed-out shades of purple and grey. The designs offered a relaxed, intimate feel, as Raina included excerpts from poetry, hand painting and embroidery in the collection, described as an autobiographical line for fall and winter. Typography and paisley were silk-screened on blouses and scarves as well as hand-embroidered tops and tunics. Frayed edges encircled sleeves of loose-fitting shirts and pant hems. Draped harem-style pants and culottes, sleeveless tops and long dresses in silk maintained the collection's laidback, casual approach.
