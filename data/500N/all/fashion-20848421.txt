Now, get back to shape with the swimsuit that acts as a slimsuit!
For women who dread revealing their lumps, bumps and less-than-perfect figures in swimwears, a new swimsuit could be the perfect solution. The Â£45 'slimsuit' or 'diet in a swimsuit' - dubbed Spanx for the beach - from Debenhams has been created after its poll of British women showed 92% fear how they look in swimwear. Despite more than half saying they had gone on a diet in an attempt to look good, they still found their costumes and bikinis ill-fitting and unflattering. The design's secret is the illusion of instant weight-loss, helping to shape the body in the same way as Spanx control tights and lingerie. ""The challenge was to use data to create a suit that accentuates the good bits, and smooths the lumpy bits without making women feel like they're wrapped in cling-film,"" the Daily Express quoted Debenhams swimwear buyer Sasha Nagalingham as saying. The suit's inner layer is made from a specially-designed heavier gauge lining fabric which does the miracle work, while the outer layer is a slinky micro-fibre. Low-rise legs ensure no bulges and a smooth curve in the hip. Moulded bust supports lift and separate in a similar way to a bra. It is sized by cup fitting as well as dress to make a perfect fit. Extra strength through the waist panel creates an cinching effect and a control panel simultaneously flattens the tummy.
