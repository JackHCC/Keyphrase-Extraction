RockMelt Rethinks Web Browser With More Social Inside
Trying to get people to use a new web browser is a tough task. Others have tried and not quite made it. But RockMelt believes it can get the (mostly younger) demographic who lives and breathes social media to attach itself to RockMelt. About 70% of RockMelt users are between 18 and 34, and 41% of its users are in high school or college. Unlike other Internet product loyalties like search engines or email, it's theoretically easier to switch web browsers, as Google Chrome has shown. But then again, that's Google. If RockMelt can break through, it’s a big opportunity. When it launched last fall, the company drew strong interest, partly due to its funding from Andreessen Horowitz, including Netscape co-founder Marc Andreessen. RockMelt integrates social networking services like Facebook and Twitter directly into the browser to make a more interactive and social experience. Facebook friends show up on the edge of the browser for quick chats, while updates from Twitter and Facebook are easily reachable on the other side of the browser. The thinking is that these social services are used the most, so it makes sense to put them at your finger tips. Since people are using the web to communicate with friends and consume information, RockMelt is attempting to bake all these services directly into the browser. RockMelt has just released a new version of the browser, RockMelt Beta 2, with several changes in response to requests from users. First it's allowing multiple Facebook chats simultaneously by placing its chat bar on the bottom of the browser. It also added a new Twitter app that gives fuller Twitter functionality, such as replies and search. Interestingly, RockMelt has also added Instapaper support, which enables people to read articles later on their mobile devices or PCs by clicking a button. This read-it-later service has become a replacement of the traditional browser bookmark for the short-attention-span, digital generation. Still, will people switch from established players in the space like Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome or Microsoft's Internet Explorer? These incumbents are increasingly becoming similar, which makes it easier for RockMelt to stand out, says with Eric Vishria, CEO and founder of RockMelt. ""Most people have no idea what a browser is,"" Vishria says. ""If you look at the differences between the browsers on the market today they're very small... With RockMelt you can see it visually so it’s very different and you can quickly understand what it is."" Vishria said RockMelt has "" a few hundred thousand"" users.
