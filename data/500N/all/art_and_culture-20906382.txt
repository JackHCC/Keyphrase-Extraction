Former Lois Lane Kidder Praises Adams Casting
Margot Kidder has welcomed the casting of her latest Lois Lane successor in the new Superman movie, insisting newly-hired Amy Adams is a ""better actress than I am"". The Enchanted star will play the intrepid reporter in director Zack Snyder's upcoming reboot of the comic book franchise, alongside Henry Cavill as the Man of Steel. Kidder, who portrayed Lane in Superman: The Movie in 1978 and three sequels with Christopher Reeve, was delighted to hear about Adams' casting, and is convinced the Oscar nominee is perfect for the role. She tells MTV, ""She's a brilliant, wonderful actress! She's incredible. She's an extraordinarily accomplished young lady - and gorgeous and full of energy and spirit. She's so different from part to part, it's going to be really interesting to see what she does with Lois. ""I think Amy Adams is so much better an actress than I am that I wouldn't even for a second presume to give her any advice on the subject at all."" Kate Bosworth was the last actress to play Lois Lane on the big screen, appearing in Bryan Singer's film Superman Returns.
